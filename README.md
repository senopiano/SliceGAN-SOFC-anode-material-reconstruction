# SliceGAN-SOFC-anode-material-reconstruction
In this project, we use SliceGAN to reconstruct the SOFC anode material from 2D images to 3D.
## Source Images
The data set is composed of a big SEM picture which has already been segmented. You can directly visit *https://edx.netl.doe.gov/dataset/sofc-microstructures-hsu-epting-mahbub-jps-2018* to have a try. Also, you can download the original pictures and then processed by *Avizo*.
