# SliceGAN-SOFC-anode-material-reconstruction
In this project, we use SliceGAN to reconstruct the SOFC anode material from 2D images to 3D.
## Source Images
The data set is composed of a big SEM picture which has already been segmented. You can directly visit *https://edx.netl.doe.gov/dataset/sofc-microstructures-hsu-epting-mahbub-jps-2018* to have a try. Also, you can download the original pictures and then processed by *Avizo*.

## SliceGAN network
You can download *Network.py* to see the code. The structure of the whole network is shown as below.

## Generated images
After the training process, we can use the netG to generate pictures. The input is a random Gaussian noise and the output is a 3D array. Turning the array to a series of RGB pictures, you can visualize these pictures with some apps like *Avizo* / *ImageJ*...
The following 6 images are generated by the trained netG. These are slices of the 3D array of 3 directions. Slice directions of the colorful pictures are *x*, *y*, *z* respectively.
